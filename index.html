        <div id="main"><h2>Introduction:</h2><br>The Treaty of Waitangi, signed in 1840 between representatives of the British Crown and various M캐ori chiefs in New Zealand, is a pivotal document in the country's history. It aimed to establish a partnership between the indigenous M캐ori people and the British Crown, guaranteeing M캐ori ownership of their lands and granting them the rights of British subjects. However, significant differences in the English and M캐ori versions of the treaty led to ongoing debates over its interpretation and implementation. The Treaty of Waitangi remains a cornerstone of New Zealand's constitutional framework, shaping relations between the government and M캐ori, and serving as a basis for addressing historical grievances and promoting reconciliation.</div>
