        <div id="main"><h2>Treaty Settlements:</h2><br>The grievances arising from breaches of the Treaty of Waitangi have led to a lengthy process of Treaty settlements between the New Zealand government and Māori iwi (tribes). These settlements aim to address historical injustices, including the loss of land, cultural suppression, and socio-economic disparities. The settlements involve financial compensation, land returns, and various forms of redress.</div>
        <div id="side"><h2>Impact on Law and Governance:</h2><br>The Treaty of Waitangi has become a cornerstone of New Zealand's constitutional framework. It is increasingly recognized in law, with courts and government institutions required to consider its principles when making decisions that affect Māori rights and interests. The Waitangi Tribunal, established in 1975, plays a crucial role in interpreting the treaty and addressing historical grievances.</div>
